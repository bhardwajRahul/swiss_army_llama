## Introduction

The Swiss Army Llama is designed to facilitate and optimize the process of working with local LLMs by using FastAPI to expose convenient REST endpoints for various tasks, including obtaining text embeddings and completions using different LLMs via llama_cpp, as well as automating the process of obtaining all the embeddings for most common document types, including PDFs (even ones that require OCR), Word files, etc; it even allows you to submit an audio file and automatically transcribes it with the Whisper model, cleans up the resulting text, and then computes the embeddings for it. To avoid wasting computation, these embeddings are cached in SQlite and retrieved if they have already been computed before. To speed up the process of loading multiple LLMs, optional RAM Disks can be used, and the process for creating and managing them is handled automatically for you. With a quick and easy setup process, you will immediately get access to a veritable "Swiss Army Knife" of LLM related tools, all accessible via a convenient Swagger UI and ready to be integrated into your own applications with minimal fuss or configuration required.

Some additional useful endpoints are provided, such as computing semantic similarity between submitted text strings. The service leverages a high-performance Rust-based library, `fast_vector_similarity`, to offer a range of similarity measures including `spearman_rho`, `kendall_tau`, `approximate_distance_correlation`, `jensen_shannon_dependency_measure`, and [`hoeffding_d`](https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2021/05/03/examples-hoeffding-d.html). Additionally, semantic search across all your cached embeddings is supported using FAISS vector searching. You can either use the built in cosine similarity from FAISS, or supplement this with a second pass that computes the more sophisticated similarity measures for the most relevant subset of the stored vectors found using cosine similarity (see the advanced semantic search endpoint for this functionality).

Also, we now support multiple embedding pooling methods for combining token-level embedding vectors into a single fixed-length embedding vector for any length of input text, including the following:
   - `mean`: Mean pooling of token embeddings.
   - `mins_maxes`: Concatenation of the minimum and maximum values of each dimension of the token embeddings.
   - `svd`: Concatenation of the first two singular vectors obtained from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the token embeddings matrix.
   - `svd_first_four`: Concatenation of the first four singular vectors obtained from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the token embeddings matrix.
   - `ica`: Flattened independent components obtained from Independent Component Analysis (ICA) of the token embeddings.
   - `factor_analysis`: Flattened factors obtained from Factor Analysis of the token embeddings.
   - `gaussian_random_projection`: Flattened embeddings obtained from Gaussian Random Projection of the token embeddings.


As mentioned above, you can now submit not only plaintext and fully digital PDFs but also MS Word documents, images, and other file types supported by the textract library. The library can automatically apply OCR using Tesseract for scanned text. The returned embeddings for each sentence in a document can be organized in various formats like records, table, etc., using the Pandas to_json() function. The results can be returned either as a ZIP file containing a JSON file or as a direct JSON response. You can now also submit audio files in MP3 or WAV formats. The library uses OpenAI's Whisper model, as optimized by the Faster Whisper Python library, to transcribe the audio into text. Optionally, this transcript can be treated like any other document, with each sentence's embeddings computed and stored. The results are returned as a URL to a downloadable ZIP file containing a JSON with the embedding vector data.

Finally, we add a new endpoint for generating multiple text completions for a given input prompt, with the ability to specify a grammar file that will enforce a particular form of response, such as JSON. There is also a useful new utility feature: a real-time application log viewer that can be accessed via a web browser, which allows for syntax highlighting and offers options for downloading the logs or copying them to the clipboard. This allows a user to watch the logs without having direct SSH access to the server.

*TLDR:* If you just want to try it very quickly on a fresh Ubuntu 22+ machine (warning, this will install docker using apt):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/swiss_army_llama
cd swiss_army_llama
chmod +x setup_dockerized_app_on_fresh_machine.sh
sudo ./setup_dockerized_app_on_fresh_machine.sh
```

To run it natively (not using Docker) in a Python venv (recommended!), you can use these commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev antiword unrtf poppler-utils pstotext tesseract-ocr flac ffmpeg lame libmad0 libsox-fmt-mp3 sox libjpeg-dev swig redis-server libpoppler-cpp-dev pkg-config -y
sudo systemctl enable redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis
git clone https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/swiss_army_llama
cd swiss_army_llama
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install wheel
python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 swiss_army_llama.py
```

Alternatively, you can also just run the included script, which will install PyEnv if it's not already installed on your machine, and then install Python 3.12 and create a virtual environment for you. You can do everything with a single one-liner from scratch on a fresh Ubuntu machine like this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/swiss_army_llama && cd swiss_army_llama && chmod +x install_swiss_army_llama.sh && ./install_swiss_army_llama.sh && pyenv local 3.12 && source venv/bin/activate && python swiss_army_llama.py
```

Then open a browser to `<your_static_ip_address>:8089` if you're using a VPS to get to the FastAPI Swagger page at `http://localhost:8089`.

Or to `localhost:8089` if you're using your own machine-- but, really, you should never run untrusted code with sudo on your own machine! Just get a cheap VPS to experiment with for $30/month.

2. **Embedding Caching**: Efficiently stores and retrieves computed embeddings in SQLite, minimizing redundant computations.
3. **Advanced Similarity Measurements and Retrieval**: Utilizes the author's own `fast_vector_similarity` library written in Rust to offer highly optimized advanced similarity measures such as `spearman_rho`, `kendall_tau`, `approximate_distance_correlation`, `jensen_shannon_dependency_measure`, and `hoeffding_d`. Semantic search across cached embeddings is also supported using FAISS vector searching.
4. **Two-Step Advanced Semantic Search**: The API first leverages FAISS and cosine similarity for rapid filtering, and then applies additional similarity measures like `spearman_rho`, `kendall_tau`, `approximate_distance_correlation`, `jensen_shannon_dependency_measure`, and `hoeffding_d` for a more nuanced comparison.
5. **File Processing for Documents**: The library now accepts a broader range of file types including plaintext, PDFs, MS Word documents, and images. It can also handle OCR automatically. Returned embeddings for each sentence are organized in various formats like records, table, etc., using Pandas to_json() function.
6. **Advanced Text Preprocessing**: The library now employs a more advanced sentence splitter to segment text into meaningful sentences. It handles cases where periods are used in abbreviations, domain names, or numbers and also ensures complete sentences even when quotes are used. It also takes care of pagination issues commonly found in scanned documents, such as awkward newlines and hyphenated line breaks.
7. **Audio Transcription and Embedding**: Upload an audio file in MP3 or WAV format. The library uses OpenAI's Whisper model for transcription. Optionally, sentence embeddings can be computed for the transcript.
8. **RAM Disk Usage**: Optionally uses RAM Disk to store models for faster access and execution. Automatically handles the creation and management of RAM Disks.
9. **Robust Exception Handling**: Features comprehensive exception management to ensure system resilience.
10. **Interactive API Documentation**: Integrates with Swagger UI for an interactive and user-friendly experience, accommodating large result sets without crashing.
11. **Scalability and Concurrency**: Built on the FastAPI framework, handles concurrent requests and supports parallel inference with configurable concurrency levels.
12. **Flexible Configurations**: Offers configurable settings through environment variables and input parameters, including response formats like JSON or ZIP files.
13. **Comprehensive Logging**: Captures essential information with detailed logs, without overwhelming storage or readability.
14. **Support for Multiple Models and Measures**: Accommodates multiple embedding models and similarity measures, allowing flexibility and customization based on user needs.
15. **Ability to Generate Multiple Completions using Specified Grammar**: Get back structured LLM completions for a specified input prompt.
16. **Real-Time Log File Viewer in Browser**: Lets anyone with access to the API server conveniently watch the application logs to gain insight into the execution of their requests.
17. **Uses Redis for Request Locking**: Uses Redis to allow for multiple Uvicorn workers to run in parallel without conflicting with each other.

## Setup and Configuration

### RAM Disk Configuration

To enable password-less sudo for RAM Disk setup and teardown, edit the `sudoers` file with `sudo visudo`. Add the following lines, replacing `username` with your actual username:

```plaintext
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/mount -t tmpfs -o size=*G tmpfs /mnt/ramdisk
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/umount /mnt/ramdisk
```

The application provides functionalities to set up, clear, and manage RAM Disk. RAM Disk is used to store models in memory for faster access. It calculates the available RAM and sets up the RAM Disk accordingly. The functions `setup_ramdisk`, `copy_models_to_ramdisk`, and `clear_ramdisk` manage these tasks.

## API Endpoints

## Exception Handling

The application has robust exception handling to deal with various types of errors, including database errors and general exceptions. Custom exception handlers are defined for `SQLAlchemyError` and general `Exception`.

## Logging

Logging is configured at the INFO level to provide detailed logs for debugging and monitoring. The logger provides information about the state of the application, errors, and activities.

The logs are stored in a file named `swiss_army_llama.log`, and a log rotation mechanism is implemented to handle log file backups. The rotating file handler is configured with a maximum file size of 10 MB, and it keeps up to 5 backup files.

When a log file reaches its maximum size, it is moved to the `old_logs` directory, and a new log file is created. The log entries are also printed to the standard output stream.

Here are some details of the logging configuration:

- Log Level: INFO
- Log Format: `%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s`
- Max Log File Size: 10 MB
- Backup Count: 5
- Old Logs Directory: `old_logs`

Additionally, the log level for SQLAlchemy's engine is set to WARNING to suppress verbose database logs.

2. **DocumentEmbedding - Document**:
   - `DocumentEmbedding` has a Foreign Key `document_hash` that references `Document`'s `document_hash`.
   - This establishes a one-to-many relationship between `Document` and `DocumentEmbedding`.

3. **AudioTranscript**:  
   - This table doesn't have a direct relationship with other tables based on the given code.

4. **Request/Response Models**:

## Performance Optimizations

This section highlights the major performance enhancements integrated into the provided code to ensure swift responses and optimal resource management.

### 1. **Asynchronous Programming**:

- **Benefit**: Handles multiple tasks concurrently, enhancing efficiency for I/O-bound operations like database transactions and network requests.
- **Implementation**: Utilizes Python's `asyncio` library for asynchronous database operations.

### 2. **Database Optimizations**:

- **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) Mode**: Enables concurrent reads and writes, optimizing for applications with frequent write demands.
- **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**: Manages locked databases by retrying operations with progressive waiting times.
- **Batch Writes**: Aggregates write operations for more efficient database interactions.
- **DB Write Queue**: Uses an asynchronous queue to serialize write operations, ensuring consistent and non-conflicting database writes.

### 3. **RAM Disk Utilization**:

- **Benefit**: Speeds up I/O-bound tasks by prioritizing operations in RAM over disk.
- **Implementation**: Detects and prioritizes a RAM disk (`/mnt/ramdisk`) if available, otherwise defaults to the standard file system.

### 4. **Model Caching**:

- **Benefit**: Reduces overhead by keeping loaded models in memory for subsequent requests.
- **Implementation**: Uses a global `model_cache` dictionary to store and retrieve models.

### 5. **Parallel Inference**:

- **Benefit**: Enhances processing speed for multiple data units, like document sentences.
- **Implementation**: Employs `asyncio.gather` for concurrent inferences, regulated by a semaphore (`MAX_CONCURRENT_PARALLEL_INFERENCE_TASKS`).

### 6. **Embedding Caching**:

- **Benefit**: Once embeddings are computed for a particular text, they are stored in the database, eliminating the need for re-computation during subsequent requests.
- **Implementation**: When a request is made to compute an embedding, the system first checks the database. If the embedding for the given text is found, it is returned immediately, ensuring faster response times.

### Dockerized Version

A bash script is included in this repo, `setup_dockerized_app_on_fresh_machine.sh`, that will automatically do everything for you, including installing docker with apt install. 

To use it, first make the script executable and then run it like this:

```bash
chmod +x setup_dockerized_app_on_fresh_machine.sh
sudo ./setup_dockerized_app_on_fresh_machine.sh
```

If you prefer a manual setup, then read the following instructions:

#### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Docker installed on your system. If not, follow these steps to install Docker on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo docker --version
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

You may need to log out and log back in or restart your system to apply the new group permissions, or use sudo in the following steps to build and run the container.

#### Setup and Running the Application

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone the Swiss Army Llama repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/swiss_army_llama
   cd swiss_army_llama
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image:**

   Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:

   ```bash
   sudo docker build -t llama-embeddings .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container:**

   Run the Docker container, mapping the container's port 8089 to the host's port 8089:

   ```bash
   sudo docker run -p 8089:8089 llama-embeddings
   ```

4. **Accessing the Application:**

   The FastAPI application will now be accessible at `http://localhost:8089` or at the static IP address of your VPS instance if you're running on one (You can get a 10-core, 30gb RAM, 1tb SSD with a static IP running Ubuntu 22.04 at Contabo for around $30/month, which is the cheapest I've found so far).

   You can interact then with the API using tools like `curl` or by accessing the FastAPI documentation at `http://localhost:8089/docs`.

5. **Viewing Logs:**

   Logs from the application can be viewed directly in the terminal where you ran the `docker run` command.

#### Stopping and Managing the Container

- To stop the running container, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal or find the container ID using `docker ps` and run `sudo docker stop <container_id>`.
- To remove the built image, use `sudo docker rmi llama-embeddings`.

---

## Startup Procedures

During startup, the application performs the following tasks:

1. **Database Initialization**:
    - The application initializes the SQLite database, setting up tables and executing important PRAGMAs to optimize performance. 
    - Some of the important SQLite PRAGMAs include setting the database to use Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode, setting synchronous mode to NORMAL, increasing cache size to 1GB, setting the busy timeout to 2 seconds, and setting the WAL autocheckpoint to 100.
2. **Initialize Database Writer**:
    - A dedicated database writer (`DatabaseWriter`) is initialized with a dedicated asynchronous queue to handle the write operations.
    - A set of hashes is created which represents the operations that are currently being processed or have already been processed. This avoids any duplicate operations in the queue.
3. **RAM Disk Setup**:
    - If the `USE_RAMDISK` variable is enabled and the user has the required permissions, the application sets up a RAM Disk.
    - The application checks if there's already a RAM Disk set up at the specified path, if not, it calculates the optimal size for the RAM Disk and sets it up.
    - If the RAM Disk is enabled but the user lacks the required permissions, the RAM Disk feature is disabled and the application proceeds without it.
4. **Model Downloads**:
    - The application downloads the required models.
5. **Model Loading**:
    - Each downloaded model is loaded into memory. If any model file is not found, an error log is recorded.
6. **Build FAISS Indexes**:
    - The application creates FAISS indexes for efficient similarity search using the embeddings from the database.
    - Associated texts are stored by model name for further use.

Note: 
- If the RAM Disk feature is enabled but the user lacks the required permissions, the application will disable the RAM Disk feature and proceed without it.
- For any database operations, if the database is locked, the application will attempt to retry the operation a few times with an exponential backoff and a jitter.

### Token-Level Embedding Vector Pooling

Pooling methods are designed to aggregate token-level embeddings, which are typically variable in length due to differing numbers of tokens in sentences or documents. By converting these token-level embeddings into a single, fixed-length vector, we ensure that each input text is represented consistently, regardless of its length. This fixed-length vector can then be used in various machine learning models that require inputs of a consistent size. 

The primary goal of these pooling methods is to retain as much useful information as possible from the original token-level embeddings while ensuring that the transformation is deterministic and does not distort the data. Each method achieves this by applying different statistical or mathematical techniques to summarize the token embeddings.

#### Explanation of Pooling Methods

1. **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)**:
   - **How it works**: Concatenates the first two singular vectors obtained from the SVD of the token embeddings matrix.
   - **Rationale**: SVD is a dimensionality reduction technique that captures the most important features of the data. Using the first two singular vectors provides a compact representation that retains significant information.

2. **SVD_First_Four**:
   - **How it works**: Uses the first four singular vectors obtained from the SVD of the token embeddings matrix.
   - **Rationale**: By using more singular vectors, this method captures more of the variance in the data, providing a richer representation while still reducing dimensionality.

3. **ICA (Independent Component Analysis)**:
    - **How it works**: Applies ICA to the embeddings matrix to find statistically independent components, then flattens the result.
    - **Rationale**: ICA is useful for identifying independent sources in the data, providing a representation that highlights these independent features.

4. **Factor_Analysis**:
    - **How it works**: Applies factor analysis to the embeddings matrix to identify underlying factors, then flattens the result.
    - **Rationale**: Factor analysis models the data in terms of latent factors, providing a summary that captures these underlying influences.

5. **Gaussian_Random_Projection**:
    - **How it works**: Applies Gaussian random projection to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings, then flattens the result.
    - **Rationale**: This method provides a fast and efficient way to reduce dimensionality while preserving the pairwise distances between points, useful for large datasets.

Thanks for your interest in my open-source project! I hope you find it useful. You might also find my commercial web apps useful, and I would really appreciate it if you checked them out:

**[YoutubeTranscriptOptimizer.com](https://youtubetranscriptoptimizer.com)** makes it really quick and easy to paste in a YouTube video URL and have it automatically generate not just a really accurate direct transcription, but also a super polished and beautifully formatted written document that can be used independently of the video.

The document basically sticks to the same material as discussed in the video, but it sounds much more like a real piece of writing and not just a transcript. It also lets you optionally generate quizzes based on the contents of the document, which can be either multiple choice or short-answer quizzes, and the multiple choice quizzes get turned into interactive HTML files that can be hosted and easily shared, where you can actually take the quiz and it will grade your answers and score the quiz for you.

**[FixMyDocuments.com](https://fixmydocuments.com/)** lets you submit any kind of document‚Äî PDFs (including scanned PDFs that require OCR), MS Word and Powerpoint files, images, audio files (mp3, m4a, etc.) ‚Äîand turn them into highly optimized versions in nice markdown formatting, from which HTML and PDF versions are automatically generated. Once converted, you can also edit them directly in the site using the built-in markdown editor, where it saves a running revision history and regenerates the PDF/HTML versions.

In addition to just getting the optimized version of the document, you can also generate many other kinds of "derived documents" from the original: interactive multiple-choice quizzes that you can actually take and get graded on; slick looking presentation slides as PDF or HTML (using LaTeX and Reveal.js), an in-depth summary, a concept mind map (using Mermaid diagrams) and outline, custom lesson plans where you can select your target audience, a readability analysis and grade-level versions of your original document (good for simplifying concepts for students), Anki Flashcards that you can import directly into the Anki app or use on the site in a nice interface, and more.
